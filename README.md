# ANZ_internship

## Overview

In this project, using the synthesised dataset containing customers' transactions around Australia in different states, we are tasked to predict the annual salary of customers.
To perform the exploratory data analysis, we used visualisation tools, namely Power BI and Tableau. For the visualisation purpose, we used "cleanedanzdataset.xlsx". This dataset is similar to the original dataset (ANZ synthesised transaction dataset.xlsx) except for an extra column to represent the index. For predictive analytics, the original dataset has been wrangled to generate custom columns to predict the annual salary.

## Prerequisite

* python
* python packages (numpy, pandas, geopandas, geopy, seaborn, matplotlib and sklearn)

#### Additional Information

The necessary information on every step is provided in the Jupyter notebook file.
